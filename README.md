## Current Projects

### 1. Redis Clone (Simple Redis)
Designed and implemented a custom Redis clone in C with the following features:
- Developed **string** and **sorted set** functionalities.
- Built core data structures like **hash tables** and **AVL trees** for efficient storage and retrieval.
- Enhanced **TCP connection management** by implementing timeout and timer functionality to dynamically track and expire the nearest timer using a **sorted linked list**.
- Optimized deletion performance for large sorted sets by implementing **multi-threading** with a thread pool.
- Used `pthread` primitives to synchronize tasks in a **multi-producer, multi-consumer queue**, improving system scalability and responsiveness.

### 2. Sky-Takeout (Food Delivery Backend)
Developed the backend of a food delivery service with key features:
- Used **ThreadLocal** to store variables shared across multiple layers of the application.
- Implemented **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** with reflection to handle common field population.
- Leveraged **Spring Cache** to reduce database load and improve performance.
- Used **Spring Task** and **WebSocket** to implement scheduled push notifications for new orders.
